-Output of randomly generated password with all variables

# Description
<p>The purpose of this project was to create a generator that will create a password based on the users desired length and includes options for numbers, upper cased letters, lower cased letters and special symbols. The output will change depending on whether or not the user wishes to have each variable included in their password.</p>

<p>To use the program, click 'Generate Password" and type in the desired length of the password which must be between 8 and 150 characters. Then select 'Ok' to add a variable or 'Cancel' to have the variable excluded from the output. Once these choices have been made, a password will be generated.
